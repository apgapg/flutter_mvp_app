# flutter_mvp_app

A sample Flutter application using MVP architecture.

Original blog: https://medium.com/@ayushpguptaapg/implementing-mvp-arch-in-flutter-app-1d67f695eab1

This app fetches a text from network and displays it in a text widget.
The code is three layered:
1. View (widgets,setState(), etc...).
2. Presenter (logic...).
3. Model (data repository like api calls, database etc).

The whole workflow in the app can be understood with this figure:
